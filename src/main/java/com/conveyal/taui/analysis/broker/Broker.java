/**
 * This class distributes the tasks making up regional jobs to workers.
 *
 * It should aim to draw tasks fairly from all organizations, and fairly from all jobs within each organization,
 * while attempting to respect the transport network affinity of each worker, giving the worker tasks that require
 * the same network it has been using recently.
 *
 * Previously workers long-polled for work, holding lots of connections open. Now they short-poll and sleep for a while
 * if there's no work. This is simpler and allows us to work withing much more standard HTTP frameworks.
 *
 * The fact that workers continuously re-poll for work every 10-30 seconds serves as a signal to the broker that
 * they are still alive and waiting. This also allows the broker to maintain a catalog of active workers.
 *
 * Because (at least currently) two organizations never share the same graph, we can get by with pulling tasks
 * cyclically or randomly from all the jobs, and actively shape the number of workers with affinity for each graph by
 * forcing some of them to accept tasks on graphs other than the one they have declared affinity for.
 *
 * This could be thought of as "affinity homeostasis". We  will constantly keep track of the ideal proportion of workers
 * by graph (based on active jobs), and the true proportion of consumers by graph (based on incoming polling), then
 * we can decide when a worker's graph affinity should be ignored and what it should be forced to.
 *
 * It may also be helpful to mark jobs every time they are skipped in the LRU queue. Each time a job is serviced,
 * it is taken out of the queue and put at its end. Jobs that have not been serviced float to the top.
 *
 * TODO: occasionally purge dead workers from workersByCategory
